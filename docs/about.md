### What and why

Active Share Styles is Active's internal CSS framework. It includes basic global styling for typography, small components like buttons and tabs, and our general guidelines for writing HTML and CSS. It's been used internally at Active for years now.

Open-sourcing Active Share Styles means sharing and learning with the community. There's a lot we can improve upon in Active Share Styles, and help is always appreciated. While we don't currently plan on building this out as a competitor to other front-end frameworks, we will occasionally add, remove, or modify things.

### Browser support

Active Share Styles currently supports Internet Explorer 9+ and the latest two versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OS X and Windows. While not a responsive or mobile-focused project, Mobile Safari and Chrome for Android should render just fine. Support for Linux-based browsers is not strictly guaranteed, but accounted for whenever possible.

### Future updates

See the [roadmap](/roadmap) for a rough outline on what's slated for future versions of Active Share Styles.

### Dependencies
